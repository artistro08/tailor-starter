## Introduction

Blog Categories entries are used to filter items in the [Posts Section](../pages/blocks/posts-section.md) and [Posts Column](../pages/blocks/section/posts-column.md) blocks. You can find the blueprint file [here](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/blueprints/content/shop/categories.yaml)

# Seed Data

## Introduction

The seed data in the theme contains the following content:&#x20;

* [Icons ](icons.md)entry type data
* [Main Menu](menus/main-menu.md) entry type data
* [Pages](pages/) entry type data
* [Social Menu](menus/social-menu.md) entry type data

## Why not more seeds?

Generating more seeds, given the current premise of the theme, would get in the way of building content. That's why we keep the seeds as little as possible.&#x20;

## Where is the Seed Data located?

It's under the `seeds/data` folder of the theme.&#x20;

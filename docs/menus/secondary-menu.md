# Secondary Menu

## Introduction

The Secondary Menu is displayed in the [`footer.htm`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/partials/footer.htm) file and uses the Bootstrap Nav to display menu content for the Main Menu Entry type defined in the [`secondary_menu.yaml`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/blueprints/content/menu/secondary\_menu.yaml) blueprint

The menu structure has a max depth of 1 which means that it does not display child content.

It uses the [`pagefinder`](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/element/form/widget-pagefinder.html) form widget to link to every entry type, but requires that the entry type has a single page to display the content.&#x20;

# Social Menu

## Introduction

The Social Menu is displayed in the [`footer.htm`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/partials/footer.htm) file and uses the Bootstrap Nav to display menu content for the Main Menu Entry type defined in the [`social_menu.yaml`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/data/social-menu.json) blueprint.

The menu structure has a max depth of 1 which means that it does not display child content.

It displays icons from the [Icons](../icons.md) entry type but defaults to the title of the menu item if the icon is not set.&#x20;

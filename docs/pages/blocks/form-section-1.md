# FAQs Section

This section is used to display frequently asked questions from the [FAQs ](../../pages-1.md)entry type.&#x20;

You can configure how many items appear in a row in the Styles tab. To organize them, simply order them in the FAQs' section in the backend.&#x20;

The section's tag name is either `section` or the `section.html_tag` in the [Advanced Tab](section/advanced-tab.md) fields if you have it set. The Advanced Tab fields also add an ID attribute and CSS Classes that you specify. You can also adjust the Bootstrap container type as well in this tab.&#x20;

You can also adjust the spacing before and after using the switches from `section.disable_top_spacing`, and `section.disable_bottom_spacing` respectfully.&#x20;

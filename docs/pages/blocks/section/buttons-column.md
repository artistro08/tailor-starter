# Buttons Column

The Buttons Column block is a block used to display buttons only. It utilizes a global partial from [`globals/buttons.htm`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/partials/builder/globals/buttons.htm) to display the buttons.&#x20;

The buttons have alignment and styling options (outline, primary, etc.)

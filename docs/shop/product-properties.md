# Product Properties

## Introduction

Product Properties are attributes for [Variable Products](products.md#variable-products). They are used to provide a reusable set of product properties. They do not include price, but they provide a quick way to add non-changing pricing variations to your products.&#x20;

### Dropdown Product Property

This allows you to add a `<select>` field to your product. It includes the following in the dropdown options:

* Title
* Slug (used for referencing and checkout)
* Switch (Enable the property)

### Color Product Property

This allows your products to have color selections. It includes the following

* Title
* Color Code
* Switch (Enable the property)

You can find all of these options in the [`properties.yaml`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/blueprints/content/shop/properties.yaml) blueprint file

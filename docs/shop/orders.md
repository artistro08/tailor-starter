# Orders

The Orders entry type is used to display order info when the Stripe Checkout process is completed. It works with a Stripe Webhook. It is recommended that you don't give your clients permission to create Orders, as it will generate emails if they do.&#x20;

The Orders entry type is determined by the [`orders.yaml` ](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/blueprints/content/shop/orders.yaml)blueprint file.

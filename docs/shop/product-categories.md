# Product Categories

## Introduction

Product Categories entries are used to filter items in the [Products Section](../pages/blocks/products-section.md) and [Products Column](../pages/blocks/section/products-column.md) blocks. You can find the blueprint file [here](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/blueprints/content/shop/categories.yaml)

# Forms

## Introduction

The Forms entry type is used to generate submittable forms with reCAPTCHA support. The field types are generated by the [`form.yaml`](https://github.com/artistro08/tailor-starter/blob/main/seeds/blueprints/forms/forms.yaml) blueprint type.

It includes form builder with various fields to create and customize form fields. It includes options to set labels, slugs, field types, placeholders, and validation rules. It also allows for setting a success message, enabling reCAPTCHA spam prevention and notifications, and adding recipients for the form.&#x20;

### Form Entry Properties

* Field Label: Used to display a label before the input field
